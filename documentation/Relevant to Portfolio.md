# Relevant to Portfolio

## Why This Project Stands Out

- **End-to-end delivery**: Data → Training → Evaluation → Deployment (UI).
- **Industry relevance**: Directly maps to CX/Support product workflows.
- **Technical rigor**: Transformer fine-tuning, weighted metrics, and baseline comparisons.

## Suggested Resume Bullets

- Built an end-to-end NLP system for customer feedback classification using Hugging Face Transformers and PyTorch; delivered a Streamlit UI for real-time inference and analysis.
- Fine-tuned `bert-base-cased` on JSONL datasets covering eight categories; selected the best model using weighted F1 and implemented early stopping.
- Implemented baseline vs fine-tuned comparisons via scikit-learn `classification_report` to quantify improvements.
- Designed a user-centric Streamlit interface with live logs, category tracking, and rolling average confidence metrics.

## Portfolio Artifacts

- **Code**: `finetune_classifier.py`, `inference.py`, `compare_models.py`, `app.py`
- **Model**: `models/feedback_classifier` directory (post-training)
- **Media**: Architecture and UI screenshots located in `assets/`
- **Demo**: Include or embed a short walkthrough video from `assets/` if available
