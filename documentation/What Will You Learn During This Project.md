# What Will You Learn During This Project

## Advanced NLP with Transformers

- Transformer Fine-Tuning with Hugging Face  
  - Learn how to adapt pre-trained transformer models (e.g., BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa) for custom classification tasks.  
  - Understand the process of loading a pre-trained model, modifying the classification head, and training on domain-specific data.  
  - Explore transfer learning benefits: faster convergence, better accuracy with limited data, and leveraging large-scale language understanding.

- Tokenization and Truncation Strategies  
  - Use Hugging Face tokenizers to convert raw text into model-ready input IDs and attention masks.  
  - Apply truncation and padding to ensure consistent input lengths (max_length=128), balancing performance and resource usage.  
  - Handle out-of-vocabulary tokens, special tokens (CLS, SEP), and understand the impact of tokenization on downstream tasks.

- Evaluation Metrics  
  - Implement and interpret accuracy, precision, recall, and weighted F1 scores for classification.  
  - Use sklearn.metrics.classification_report to generate detailed performance summaries.  
  - Learn the importance of class imbalance and how weighted metrics provide a fair assessment.

## Hugging Face Ecosystem

- Transformers Trainer and TrainingArguments  
  - Configure training with TrainingArguments: batch size, epochs, learning rate, evaluation strategy, logging, and checkpointing.  
  - Integrate early stopping and custom callbacks to optimize training and prevent overfitting.  
  - Monitor training progress with built-in logging and visualization tools.

- Pipeline-Based Inference  
  - Deploy models using Hugging Face pipeline for text classification.  
  - Obtain predictions with confidence scores, enabling threshold-based decision making.  
  - Build robust inference scripts that handle batch inputs and return structured outputs.

- Datasets Creation and Preprocessing  
  - Create Hugging Face Dataset objects from Python lists, JSONL files, or Pandas DataFrames.  
  - Map custom preprocessing functions for tokenization, label encoding, and feature extraction.  
  - Split datasets into train/test/validation sets, ensuring reproducibility and stratification.

## Machine Learning Engineering

- Training Pipeline Design  
  - Architect modular training scripts with clear separation of data loading, preprocessing, model setup, training, and evaluation.  
  - Implement stratified train/test splits to preserve label distribution and avoid bias.  
  - Save and load model checkpoints for reproducibility and deployment.

- Experimentation and Model Comparison  
  - Compare baseline models (e.g., logistic regression, naive Bayes) with fine-tuned transformers.  
  - Use metrics and visualizations to analyze improvements and justify model choices.  
  - Document experiments, hyperparameters, and results for future reference.

- Resource Handling  
  - Detect and utilize available hardware (CPU/GPU) for training and inference.  
  - Optimize batch sizes and data loaders for efficient resource usage.  
  - Handle out-of-memory errors and fallback gracefully to CPU if GPU is unavailable.

## Web App Development (Streamlit)

- UI Construction with Custom CSS  
  - Build interactive web interfaces using Streamlit components: text inputs, buttons, file uploaders, and data tables.  
  - Apply custom CSS for branding, layout, and improved user experience.  
  - Design responsive dashboards for real-time feedback and visualization.

- Session State Management  
  - Use Streamlitâ€™s session state to persist logs, statistics, and user analysis history across interactions.  
  - Implement features like user authentication, feedback tracking, and session-based personalization.

- Operational Feedback  
  - Display progress bars, status messages, and error notifications within the app.  
  - Show model metrics, predictions, and analysis results in a user-friendly format.  
  - Log user actions and system events for debugging and monitoring.

## Data Handling

- JSONL Format Ingestion  
  - Read and parse JSONL files for training and testing data.  
  - Validate data integrity, handle missing values, and preprocess text fields.  
  - Automate data ingestion pipelines for scalability and reliability.

- Stratified Splits  
  - Use stratified sampling to ensure train/test splits maintain label proportions.  
  - Prevent data leakage and ensure fair evaluation by separating data correctly.  
  - Visualize label distributions before and after splitting.

## Software Practices

- Project Structure Separation  
  - Organize code into logical modules: training, inference, UI, utilities, and configuration.  
  - Use clear directory structures for data, models, scripts, and documentation.  
  - Adopt naming conventions and code organization for maintainability.

- Configuration in Code  
  - Centralize configuration parameters (model name, batch size, epochs, learning rate) in a config file or class.  
  - Enable easy experimentation by changing settings without modifying core logic.  
  - Document configuration options and their impact on results.

- Clear Function Responsibilities  
  - Write focused functions and classes with single responsibilities.  
  - Use docstrings and type hints for clarity and maintainability.  
  - Refactor code to avoid duplication and improve readability.

## Example Workflow

  - Set up TrainingArguments and Trainer.  
  - Train the model, monitor metrics, and save checkpoints.

- Evaluation  
  - Run predictions on the test set.  
  - Generate classification reports and confusion matrices.  
  - Compare results with baseline models.

- Deployment  
  - Export the trained model and tokenizer.  
  - Build a Streamlit app for interactive inference.  
  - Integrate the Hugging Face pipeline for real-time predictions.

- User Interaction  
  - Users submit feedback via the web app.  
  - The app displays predictions, confidence scores, and logs.  
  - Session state tracks user history and analysis.

- Maintenance  
  - Update models with new data.  
  - Monitor app performance and user feedback.  
  - Refactor and extend codebase as needed.

## Best Practices and Tips

- Always validate data before training.
- Use version control (e.g., Git) for code and model checkpoints.
- Document every step: data sources, preprocessing, model configs, results.
- Test code modules independently before integration.
- Monitor resource usage and optimize for deployment environments.
- Engage in continuous learning: experiment with new models, techniques, and tools.
