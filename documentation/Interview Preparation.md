# Interview Preparation

## Talking Points (Grounded in This Project)

- End-to-end pipeline: JSONL data → Trainer fine-tuning (`bert-base-cased`) → `models/feedback_classifier` → `inference.py` → Streamlit UI.
- Metrics: Used weighted F1, accuracy, precision, recall during evaluation.
- Early stopping and callback: Stopped overfitting; real-time feedback callback demonstrates human-in-the-loop concept.
- Baseline vs fine-tuned: `compare_models.py` produces `classification_report` for both.
- Inference design: Uses Hugging Face `pipeline`, returns top label and confidence; auto-selects GPU when available.

## Code Walkthrough Prompts

- Training arguments choices (epochs, LR, batch size) and their impact.
- Tokenization decisions (`max_length=128`) for typical feedback lengths.
- Data splitting rationale: stratified to maintain label balance.
- UI states and logging: session state, rolling average confidence, category tracking.

## Demo Flow

1. Show `models/feedback_classifier` exists after training.
2. Run `streamlit run app.py` and analyze a few samples.
3. Show logs, metrics, and classification outputs.
4. Optional: Run `compare_models.py` to present improvement over baseline.

## Q&A Preparation

- How would you add a new label? Update label lists, retrain model, adjust UI mapping.
- How to speed up inference? Use DistilBERT or enable quantization; cache model in app.
- How to handle multilingual text? Switch to multilingual checkpoints and retrain.
- How to handle class imbalance? Weighted loss or data resampling during training.
